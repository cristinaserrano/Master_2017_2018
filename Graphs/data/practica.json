   "about": "I've been writing as long as I can remember and all of my stories always held a thread of romance (even when I was writing about a prince who could shoot lasers out of his eyes). I love creating unique characters, love giving them happy endings and I even love the voices in my head. There's no other job I would rather be doing. In September 2002, when I got the call that Silhouette Desire wanted to buy my first book, Desert Warrior, it was a dream come true. I hope to continue living the dream until I keel over of old age on my keyboard.<br /><br /><br />I was born in Fiji and raised in New Zealand. I also spent three years living and working in Japan, during which time I took the chance to travel around Asia. I\u2019m back in New Zealand now, but I\u2019m always plotting new trips. If you\u2019d like to see some of my travel snapshots, have a look at the Travel Diary page (updated every month).<br /><br />So far, I've worked as a lawyer, a librarian, a candy factory general hand, a bank temp and an English teacher and not necessarily in that order. Some might call that inconsistency but I call it grist for the writer's mill.<br /><br />",

   "about": "Angela Knight is an American author of mostly erotic fantasy. She was a reporter for ten years and a comic book author. She lives in South Carolina. First published under Red Sage, she was able to write romantic fiction for the first time in 1996. She published several short stories in their Secrets anthologies. Editor Cindy Hwang brought her to Berkley Publishing and has helped her become a best selling author.<br /><br />When developing her Mageverse series she wanted to create a unique spin on the vampire tale. Taking the Arthurian legend and twisting it, she has vampires that are not evil, still possess their souls, and can reproduce. Merlin was an alien who traveled to Earth from the Mageverse (an alternate world where magic is everywhere) to establish protectors. Merlin's race had seen species that destroyed themselves as they advanced. To avoid this, he searched Earth for worthy men and women who would give everything to protect others. After drinking from the Grail, men became Magi, vampires and women became Majae, witches. They have a symbiotic relationship. The Magi have to drink blood from the Majae to help absorb the energies of the Mageverse. The Majae have to donate blood or they will suffer heart attack from excess blood and elevated pressure. The Majae are the magic in the Mageverse. The Magi also sleep during the day as another means of gaining magic. The men and women could theoretically live forever, should they not be killed.<br /><br />They are capable of reproducing with mortals to ensure that there are more potential candidates to recruit. Anyone born of such a union is a Latent. Their Gift, becoming Magi or Majae, is triggered by three or sexual encounters with a Gifted man or woman. A Latent must be approved by the Magi or Majae councils. Many can not psychologically handle the impact of the Mageverse (It can trigger insanity). There are professional court seducers who Gift latents on the Councils orders.<br /><br />On Mageverse Earth, there are Fairies, Dragons, Unicorns and the city of Avalon where the Magi and Majae live. They magically create gates to travel to Realspace Earth. The Fairies are featured in Master of the Moon, which has King Llyr of the Faeries.<br /><br />Merlin, who knows that power can corrupt, created another magical species in case the Magi and Majae become out of control. These are werewolves. They do not have to wait until the full moon to change. They are a rigid society that has been hidden from their inception. In Master of Wolves, the werewolves declare themselves and fight alongside the Magi and the Fairies.<br /><br />Master of Swords introduces the dragons of Mageverse in more depth and the hero for Master of Dragons is introduced.<br /><br />Futuristic Books<br /><br />Jane's Warlord introduces Jane Colby, a 20th century reporter. Baran Arvid is sent back from the future to protect her from another time traveler, Druas. Druas travels back in time to commit the Jack the Ripper murders and his next target is Jane. Baran is a technologically and genetically enhanced human classified as a Warlord.<br /><br />Mercenaires is three short stories (originally published electronically) set in a future like Baran\u2019s. They can be technologically and genetically enhanced. Space travel has extended to other galaxies and other life forms have been discovered. Humans have established many new colonies on planets capable of sustaining life.",

   "about": "Lynn began her writing career at the tender age of five with a series of illustrated novellas entitled Clinton\u2019s Troubles in which the compelling hero found himself in all sorts of . . . well, trouble. She was living in Hawaii at the time and the scope for her imagination (poisoned fish, tropical cliffs, large spiders) was great and poor Clinton bore the brunt of it. After returning to the mainland, her writing gave way to training in classical music and Clinton, who had been felled with arrows, eaten by fish and sent tumbling off cars, was put aside for operatic heroes in tights.<br /><br />Somehow during high school, in between bouts of Verdi and Rossini, she managed to find time to submerge herself in equal parts Tolkien, Barbara Cartland and Mad Magazine. During college, a chance encounter with a large library stack of romances left her hooked, gave her the courage to put pen to paper herself, and finally satisfied that need for a little bit of fantasy with a whole lot of romance!<br />",

   "about": "Charlaine Harris has been a published novelist for over twenty-five years. A native of the Mississippi Delta, she grew up in the middle of a cotton field. Now she lives in southern Arkansas with her husband, her three children, three dogs, and a duck. The duck stays outside.<br /><br />Though her early output consisted largely of ghost stories, by the time she hit college (Rhodes, in Memphis) Charlaine was writing poetry and plays. After holding down some low-level jobs, she had the opportunity to stay home and write, and the resulting two stand-alones were published by Houghton Mifflin. After a child-producing sabbatical, Charlaine latched on to the trend of writing mystery series, and soon had her own traditional books about a Georgia librarian, Aurora Teagarden. Her first Teagarden, <i>Real Murders</i>, garnered an Agatha nomination.<br /><br />Soon Charlaine was looking for another challenge, and the result was the much darker Lily Bard series. The books, set in Shakespeare, Arkansas, feature a heroine who has survived a terrible attack and is learning to live with its consequences. <br /><br />When Charlaine began to realize that neither of those series was ever going to set the literary world on fire, she regrouped and decided to write the book she\u2019d always wanted to write. Not a traditional mystery, nor yet pure science fiction or romance, <i>Dead Until Dark</i> broke genre boundaries to appeal to a wide audience of people who just enjoy a good adventure. Each subsequent book about Sookie Stackhouse, telepathic Louisiana barmaid and friend to vampires, werewolves, and various other odd creatures, has drawn more readers. The Southern Vampire books are published in Japan, Great Britain, Greece, Germany, Thailand, Spain, France, and Russia.<br /><br />In addition to Sookie, Charlaine has another heroine with a strange ability. Harper Connelly, lightning-struck and strange, can find corpses\u2026 and that\u2019s how she makes her living.<br /><br />In addition to her work as a writer, Charlaine is the past senior warden of St. James Episcopal Church, a board member of Mystery Writers of America, a past board member of Sisters in Crime, a member of the American Crime Writers League, and past president of the Arkansas Mystery Writers Alliance. She spends her \"spare\" time reading, watching her daughter play sports, traveling, and going to the movies.",

   "about": "Ilona Andrews is the pseudonym for a husband-and-wife writing team. Ilona is a native-born Russian and Gordon is a former communications sergeant in the U.S. Army. Contrary to popular belief, Gordon was never an intelligence officer with a license to kill, and Ilona was never the mysterious Russian spy who seduced him. They met in college, in English Composition 101, where Ilona got a better grade. (Gordon is still sore about that.)<br /><br />Gordon and Ilona currently reside in Oregon with their two children, three dogs and a cat. They have co-authored two series, the bestselling urban fantasy of Kate Daniels and romantic urban fantasy of The Edge.<br />",

Growing up in a family where a weekly visit to the library was a given, Katie spent much of her time with her nose buried in a book. Despite her love for novels, she didn't think of writing them until she was contracted to write a non-fiction book about software. Since her editor refused to allow her to include either witty dialogue or love scenes in the software book, Katie swiftly resolved to switch to fiction, where she could indulge in world building, tormenting characters, and falling madly in love with all her heroes.<br /><br />Two years after she started writing novels, Katie sold her first romance, Noble Intentions. More than thirty books followed during the years after Noble's publication. Her novels have been translated into numerous languages, been recorded as audiobooks, received several awards, and placed on the New York Times, USA Today, and Publishers Weekly bestseller lists. She also writes for the young adult audience as Katie Maxwell, and for the mystery world as Kate Marsh.<br /><br />Katie lives in the Pacific Northwest with her husband and dogs, and can often be found lurking around online.<br /><br />",

Since then, her books have appeared consistently on national bestseller lists. With thirty two books in print and novellas in nine anthologies, she has been a finalist in the prestigious Rita Awards three times, as well as receiving several nominations from Romantic Times, including one for Career Achievement in Series Romantic Suspense.<br /><br />Each book in her World of the Lupi series gains a larger audience. It was originally sold in the Romance section of bookstores, but more and more you will be able to find copies cross-shelved under Sci-Fi and Fantasy as the popularity of the series grows!<br /><br />Eileen has lived in the West Texas town of Midland, TX for over 30 years--three years as a young teen, and the remaining years since she moved back here as an adult. When she first started writing over 10 years ago, it hit her like the first drink for an alcoholic . . . or the first kiss for Romeo and Juliet.<br /><br />She came to writing romance in a roundabout way. Having read and loved science fiction for years, that\u2019s where she first tried her hand when the writing bug bit. Somehow her stories always ended up having a strong romantic subplot, but she hadn\u2019t read a romance since the early 80\u2019s and didn\u2019t think \u201cthose little books\u201d were her kind of stories. But when a friend in her critique group began working on a romance novel, Wilks decided she needed to give the genre another try. She asked her friend to recommend some titles--and quicker than you can say \u201cJayne Ann Krentz,\u201d she fell in love. The genre had been busy growing up while she wasn\u2019t watching.

Jane is a full blooded Cherokee skinwalker and hunter of rogue-vampires in a world of weres, witches, vampires, and other supernats.<br /><br />Her Rogue Mage novels\u2014Bloodring, Seraphs, Host, and the RPG Rogue Mage\u2014feature Thorn St. Croix, a stone mage in a post-apocalyptic alternate reality.<br /><br />The Soulwood series is a new dark-urban fantasy / paranormal police procedural /thriller series featuring Nell Nicholson Ingram.<br /><br />Faith writes full-time, tries to keep house, and is a workaholic. She gave up cooking for lent one year and the oven hasn\u2019t been turned on since. Okay \u2013 that\u2019s a joke. She does still make cold cereal and sandwiches. Occasionally, she remembers to sweep or use the vacuum cleaner. <br /><br />Faith researches in great detail, and tries most everything her characters do. Research led to her life\u2019s passions \u2013 jewelry making, orchids, bones, travel, white-water kayaking, and writing.<br /><br />Jewelry-making was the occupation of two of her characters: Thorn St. Croix, the Rogue Mage, and the main character of BloodStone, written by her pen name, Gwen Hunter. She fell in love with the art form. Faith makes, wears, and sometimes gives away her jewelry as promo items to fans and as prizes in contests. See her FaceBook Fan Page at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/official.faith.hunter\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.facebook.com/official.fait...</a> for pics. She works with stones, pearls, crystal, and glass, wire wrapping larger, undrilled, focal stones. Labradorite, Amazonite, apatite, aquamarine, and prehnite are her favorite stones. <br /><br />Faith loves 20 orchids. Her favorite time of year is when several are blooming. Pictures can be seen at her FaceBook page. And yes, she collects bones and skulls. Many of her orchid pics are juxtaposed with bones and skulls \u2014a fox, cat, dog, cow skull, goat skull, (that is, unfortunately, falling apart) and the jawbone of an ass. She just received a boar skull, and the skull of a mountain lion (legally purchased from a US tannery) killed in the wild.<br /><br />She and her husband RV, traveling with their rescued Pomeranians to whitewater rivers all over the Southeast. (The poms don\u2019t whitewater. The pampered dogs stay in the RV in air-conditioned comfort!) <br /><br />And that leads Faith to kayaking \u2013 her very favorite sport. Faith discovered whitewater paddling when she was researching her (Gwen Hunter) mystery book, Rapid Descent. She took a lesson and\u2014after a bout of panic attacks from fear of drowning\u2014discovered she loved the sport.<br /><br />Faith is one of the founders and a participant at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.MagicalWords.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.MagicalWords.net</a>, an online writing forum geared to helping writers. And she is a voracious reader.<br /><br />Under other pen names, notably, Gwen Hunter, she writes action adventure, mysteries, and thrillers. As Gwen, she is a winner of the WH Smith Literary Award for Fresh Talent in 1995 in the UK, and won a Romantic Times Reviewers Choice Award in 2008.

A pure adrenaline, white-knucked thriller, Swerve releases on July 7, 2015 -- perfect for the novel's Fourth of July setting. If you're looking for a romance with little to no violence ... this is not your novel. If, as with her other work, you're looking for a strong female protagonist who comes out swinging when pushed into a corner, then perhaps you can connect. Welcome!",

   "about": "Yes, I have a lot of books, and if this is your first visit to my amazon author page, it can be a little overwhelming. If you are new to my work, let me recommend a few titles as good places to start. I love my Dan Shamble, Zombie P.I. series, humorous horror/mysteries, which begin with DEATH WARMED OVER. My steampunk fantasy adventures, CLOCKWORK ANGELS and CLOCKWORK LIVES, written with Neil Peart, legendary drummer from Rush, are two of my very favorite novels ever. And my magnum opus, the science fiction epic The Saga of Seven Suns, begins with HIDDEN EMPIRE. After you've tried those, I hope you'll check out some of my other series.<br /><br />I have written spin-off novels for Star Wars, StarCraft, Titan A.E., and The X-Files, and is the co-author of the Dune prequels. His original works include the Saga of Seven Suns series and the Nebula Award-nominated Assemblers of Infinity. He has also written several comic books including the Dark Horse Star Wars collection Tales of the Jedi written in collaboration with Tom Veitch, Predator titles (also for Dark Horse), and X-Files titles for Topps.<br /><br />I serve as a judge in the Writers of the Future contest.<br /><br />My wife is author Rebecca Moesta.

Fortunately, she branched out from there and after a few years trying to be a screenwriter, a comic book writer and the author of copious amounts of fanfiction, she tried to write a novel again. Her epic dark fantasy (thankfully) never saw the light of day but while she was struggling with elves and sorcerers she got the idea of writing a story about a werewolf who fought crime.<br /><br />Two years and many, many drafts later, she pitched Night Life to a bevy of agents and one of them, Rachel Vater, sold the series to St. Martin\u2019s.<br /><br />Caitlin collects comic books, print books, vintage clothes, and bad habits. She loves tea, loud music, the color black (especially mixed with the color pink) and ghost stories. She can drive a stick shift, play the violin and knows more English curses than American ones.<br /><br />Caitlin lives in Olympia, WA with two pushy cats.<br /><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://us.macmillan.com/bonegods/CaitlinKittredge\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://us.macmillan.com/bonegods/Cait...</a>",

   "about": "\"Born in Halifax, Nova Scotia: Although I haven't actually lived \"down east\" since just before my fourth birthday, I still consider myself a Maritimer. I think it's something to do with being born in sight of the ocean. Or possibly with the fact that almost no one admits to being from Ontario\u2026<br /><br />Raised, for the most part, in Kingston, Ontario. It was the late sixties, early to mid seventies. Enough said for those of us who lived through it-and those who didn't seem to be getting another chance to fall off platform shoes.<br /><br />Spent three years in the Canadian Naval Reserve: I was a cook. They'd just opened it up to women and I figured it would be the first trade that would send women to sea. I was right. Unfortunately it happened a year after I left. No tattoos.<br /><br />Received a degree in RADIO AND TELEVISION ARTS (B.A.A.) from Ryerson Polytechnical Institute: The year I graduated was the year that the CBC laid off 750 employees in Toronto alone. We were competing for jobs with people who had up to five years experience. The cat threw up on my degree.<br /><br />Spent eight years working at Bakka, North America's oldest surviving science fiction book store: Change Of Hobbit in California was actually a very little bit older but unfortunately it was a casualty of the recession in '91. During those eight years, while working full-time, I wrote seven books (the first seven, except for the original draft of CHILD), and nine short stories.<br /><br />In 1992, after living in downtown Toronto, a city of nearly three million, for thirteen years, I moved with two large cats, one small psychotic cat, and my partner out to a rented house in the middle of nowhere. In the years since, we've purchased the house, buried two of the original cats, replaced them with three more felines and, unintentionally, acquired a Chihuahua. You're probably wondering how two reasonably intelligent adults can unintentionally acquire a Chihuahua. Please don't ask.<br /><br />I love living in the country, writing full-time, anything by Charles de Lint, Xena, Hercules, and email. I dislike telephones, electric blankets, and bathroom renovations.<br /><br />I always expect catastrophe; as a result, I'm usually pleasantly surprised.\"<br /><br />Huff lives with her wife, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/69803.Fiona_Patton\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fiona Patton</a>.",

Although she always wanted to become a writer, Glick was convinced that her lack of spelling skills meant that her goal was unattainable. As a stay-at-home mother, she took a community college course to help her choose a career. The course made it very clear that writing was her primary interest. Glick began writing articles for newspapers and magazines, but after several years decided to try writing fiction. Her first book, a kids' science fiction book, was finally purchased by Scholastic Inc..<br /><br />Since then, Glick has become a highly successful author of over 50 romantic suspense and paranormal novels. Many of her novels are published under the Harlequin Intrigue line, and in June 2003, she became one of the first authors published under Berkley's new Sensation imprint. Before 1997, she often collaborated with Eileen Buckholtz and Kathryn Jenson.<br /><br />Glick also is a highly regarded author of cookbooks focusing on healthy eating. She sometimes hires trained chefs to test the recipes that she creates, and makes sure that every recipe is tested at least three times before it appears in one of her cookbooks.<br /><br />Glick is the head of the Columbia Writers Workshop. She and her husband, Norman Glick, live in Columbia, Maryland, where Ruth collects rocks, and enjoys cooking, walking, reading, gardening, travel, and Mozart operas. They have two grown children, Elissa and Ethan, and two grandsons (Jesse and Leo).",

   "about": "Mike Mignola was born September 16, 1960 in Berkeley, California and grew up in nearby Oakland. His fascination with ghosts and monsters began at an early age (he doesn't remember why) and reading <i>Dracula</i> at age 13 introduced him to Victorian literature and folklore from which he has never recovered.<br /><br />In 1982, hoping to find a way to draw monsters for a living, he moved to New York City and began working for Marvel Comics, first as a (very terrible) inker and then as an artist on comics like <i>Rocket Raccoon</i>, <i>Alpha Flight</i> and <i>The Hulk</i>. By the late 80s he had begun to develop his signature style (thin lines, clunky shapes and lots of black) and moved onto higher profile commercial projects like <i>Cosmic Odyssey</i> (1988) and <i>Gotham by Gaslight</i> (1989) for DC Comics, and the not-so-commercial <i>Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser</i> (1990) for Marvel. In 1992, he drew the comic book adaptation of the film <i>Bram Stoker's Dracula</i> for Topps Comics.<br /><br />In 1993, Mike moved to Dark Horse comics and created <i>Hellboy</i>, a half-demon occult detective who may or may not be the Beast of the Apocalypse. While the first story line (<i>Seed of Destruction</i>, 1994) was co-written by John Byrne, Mike has continued writing the series himself. There are, at this moment, 13 <i>Hellboy</i> graphic novel collections (with more on the way), several spin-off titles (<i>B.P.R.D.</i>, <i>Lobster Johnson</i>, <i>Abe Sapien</i> and <i>Witchfinder</i>), three anthologies of prose stories, several novels, two animated films and two live-action films staring Ron Perlman. <i>Hellboy</i> has earned numerous comic industry awards and is published in a great many countries.<br /><br />Mike also created the award-winning comic book <i>The Amazing Screw-on Head</i> and has co-written two novels (<i>Baltimore, or, the Steadfast Tin Soldier and the Vampire</i> and <i>Joe Golem and the Drowning City</i>) with best-selling author Christopher Golden.<br /><br />Mike worked (very briefly) with Francis Ford Coppola on his film <i>Bram Stoker's Dracula</i> (1992), was a production designer on the Disney film <i>Atlantis: The Lost Empire</i> (2001) and was visual consultant to director Guillermo del Toro on <i>Blade II</i> (2002), <i>Hellboy</i> (2004) and <i>Hellboy II: The Golden Army</i> (2008).

   "about": "I live in the teeny, tiny town of Taylor, NY, (Alliteration Alert!) though my mailing address is Cincinnatus, my telephone exchange is Truxton and I pay taxes and vote in Cuyler. All of these are at least in the same rural county in the southern hills of New York State; Cortland County. There are more cattle than people here. The nearest \u201cbig\u201d cities are Syracuse and Binghamton and they are an hour away, in different directions, and not really all that big by most standards, though they both seem humongous to me. I look out my window to see rolling, green, thickly forested hills, wildflower laden meadows and wide open blue, blue skies. My road is barely paved. The nearest neighboring place is a 700 acre dairy farm.<br /><br />My house is a big, century old farmhouse. I moved in here after my divorce in 2006. Just a little over a year later, the house, which I had named, SERENITY, burned. It was 99% gutted, and I lost my two dogs, Sally, an 11-year-old great Dane, and Wrinkles, my 14-year-old, blind bulldog. This was the culmination of my Dark Night of the soul, which had seemed to hit me all at once in 2006-2007. My mother died that year, after a 14 month battle with pancreatic cancer. She was only 60. The youngest of my five daughters had left home that same year, and while that\u2019s not a tragedy at all, it felt like one to me. Then came the divorce. And finally there was the fire--it seemed my darkest night wasn\u2019t quite finished with me after all. I had lost almost everything before that point, and as I poked through the wet ashes and soot the next day, I realized that I had now been stripped all the way to the bone.<br /><br />No better time to start over. (And no, I didn\u2019t come to that realization that day--there were a few days of wallowing in pity first, particularly the day after the fire, when I hit a deer and smashed up my car, which I was practically living in!)<br /><br />That\u2019s when I started to laugh. Just sat on the side of the road as the deer bounded, uninjured and carefree, out of sight, and laughed. It was just too ridiculous at that point, to do anything else!<br /><br />And from there, I picked myself up, and brushed myself off, and said, okay, there\u2019s only one way to go from here. Forward. And that\u2019s what I did. There I was at the age of harrurmphemmph, living in my one, mostly undamaged remaining room, with a dorm-sized mini-fridge, a futon, a TV, my cat (nine lives!) and a laptop. And not much else. (Though thank goodness the room that survived the fire, was a room that had its own attached bathroom!)<br /><br />Since then I have rebuilt my beloved home, which really has become my haven, my \u201cSerenity.\u201d I share it now with my fianc\u00e9, Lance, and we have accumulated quite the little family together. \u201cLittle\u201d being a relative term. We have a pair of English Mastiffs, Dozer and Daisy, who weigh 203 pounds and 208 pounds respectively, and a little pudgy English Bulldog named Niblet, who is bigger than both of them, inside her mind. We also have the aforementioned cat, Glorificus (\u201cGlory\u201d for short,) who adores her canine pups and keeps them firmly in line. And we've acquired a pair of stray cats as well, a mother and son, Luna (Lulu for short) and Butters aka Buddy. Lulu showed up pregnant during a lunar eclipse, had a litter, and vanished again. We found homes for all the kittens except one. Butters. We got him fixed and kept him. A few months later, Lulu returned, again expecting. This litter was born on the \"Monster Moon.\" Again, all the kittens were spayed and neutered and placed in homes, and this time we got Lulu to the vet in time to spay her before the cycle could repeat. <br /><br />Glory is not amused.<br /><br />She has a story of her own, my old Glory cat, having been with me before the Dark Times descended, she went through it all with me, moved with me, survived the fire, and remains with me still. She's tolerating the newcomers. Barely.<br /><br />My partner is an artist, a mechanic, a welder and an inventor, and the rumors are true, he is much younger than I",

His debut novel was Healer (1976). Wilson is also a part-time practicing family physician. He made his first sales in 1970 to Analog and continued to write science fiction throughout the seventies. In 1981 he ventured into the horror genre with the international bestseller, The Keep, and helped define the field throughout the rest of the decade. In the 1990s he became a true genre hopper, moving from science fiction to horror to medical thrillers and branching into interactive scripting for Disney Interactive and other multimedia companies. He, along with Matthew J. Costello, created and scripted FTL Newsfeed which ran daily on the Sci-Fi Channel from 1992-1996.<br /><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://us.macmillan.com/author/fpaulwilson\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://us.macmillan.com/author/fpaulw...</a>",

   "about": "Brief biographies are, like history texts, too organized to be other than orderly misrepresentations of the truth. So when it's written that Lucius Shepard was born in August of 1947 to Lucy and William Shepard in Lynchburg, Virginia, and raised thereafter in Daytona Beach, Florida, it provides a statistical hit and gives you nothing of the difficult childhood from which he frequently attempted to escape, eventually succeeding at the age of fifteen, when he traveled to Ireland aboard a freighter and thereafter spent several years in Europe, North Africa, and Asia, working in a cigarette factory in Germany, in the black market of Cairo's Khan al Khalili bazaar, as a night club bouncer in Spain, and in numerous other countries at numerous other occupations. On returning to the United States, Shepard entered the University of North Carolina, where for one semester he served as the co-editor of the Carolina Quarterly. Either he did not feel challenged by the curriculum, or else he found other pursuits more challenging. Whichever the case, he dropped out several times and traveled to Spain, Southeast Asia (at a time when tourism there was generally discouraged), and South and Central America. He ended his academic career as a tenth-semester sophomore with a heightened political sensibility, a fairly extensive knowledge of Latin American culture and some pleasant memories.<br /><br />Toward the beginning of his stay at the university, Shepard met Joy Wolf, a fellow student, and they were married, a union that eventually produced one son, Gullivar, now an architect in New York City. While traveling cross-country to California, they had their car break down in Detroit and were forced to take jobs in order to pay for repairs. As fortune would have it, Shepard joined a band, and passed the better part of the 1970s playing rock and roll in the Midwest. When an opportunity presented itself, usually in the form of a band break-up, he would revisit Central America, developing a particular affection for the people of Honduras. He intermittently took odd jobs, working as a janitor, a laborer, a sealer of driveways, and, in a nearly soul-destroying few months, a correspondent for Blue Cross/Blue Shield, a position that compelled him to call the infirm and the terminally ill to inform them they had misfiled certain forms and so were being denied their benefits.<br /><br />In 1980 Shepard attended the Clarion Writers\u2019 Workshop at Michigan State University and thereafter embarked upon a writing career. He sold his first story, \"Black Coral,\" in 1981 to New Dimensions, an anthology edited by Marta Randall. During a prolonged trip to Central America, covering a period from 1981-1982, he worked as a freelance journalist focusing on the civil war in El Salvador. Since that time he has mainly devoted himself to the writing of fiction. His novels and stories have earned numerous awards in both the genre and the mainstream.<br />",

Her stories blurred the line between reality and perception by making the human mind a real and explorable place.

   "about": "I\u2019ve been writing stories and poems since I was eight years old. My first poem was about Halloween: \"What is tonight? What is tonight?/Try to guess and you\u2019ll guess right.\" Perhaps this inauspicious beginning explains why it took me till I was in my thirties to sell a novel. It occurred to me early on that it might take some time and a lot of tries before I was able to publish any of my creative writing, so I pursued a degree in journalism at Northwestern University so I\u2019d be able to support myself while I figured out how to write fiction.<br /><br />I\u2019ve spent most of my journalism career at three trade and association magazines\u2014The Professional Photographer (which, as you might guess, went to studio and industrial photographers), DECOR (which went to frame shop and art gallery owners), and BizEd (which is directed at deans and professors at business schools). My longest stint, seventeen years, was at DECOR. Many people don\u2019t know this, but I\u2019m a CPF (Certified Picture Framer), having passed a very long, technical test to prove I understood the tenets of conservation framing. Now I write about management education and interview some really cool, really smart people from all over the world.<br /><br />I mostly write my fiction in the evenings and on weekends. It requires a pretty obsessive-compulsive personality to be as prolific as I\u2019ve been in the past ten years and hold down a full-time job. But I do manage to tear myself away from the computer now and then to do something fun. I read as often as I can, across all genres, though I\u2019m most often holding a book that\u2019s fantasy or romance, with the occasional western thrown in. I\u2019m a fan of Cardinals baseball and try to be at the ballpark on opening day. If I had the time, I\u2019d see a movie every day of my life. I love certain TV shows so much that knowing a new episode is going to air that night will make me happy all day. (I\u2019m a huge Joss Whedon fan, but in the past I\u2019ve given my heart to shows all over the map in terms of quality: \"Knight Rider,\" \"Remington Steele,\" \"Blake\u2019s 7,\" \"Moonlighting,\" \"The Young Riders,\" \"Cheers,\" \"Hill Street Blues,\" \"X-Files,\" \"Lost,\" \"Battlestar Galactica\"...you can probably fill in the gaps. And let\u2019s not forget my very first loves, \"The Partridge Family,\" \"Here Come the Brides\" and \"Alias Smith &amp; Jones.\")<br /><br />I don\u2019t have kids, I don\u2019t want pets, and all my plants die, so I\u2019m really only forced to provide ongoing care for my menagerie of stuffed animals. All my friends are animal lovers, though, and someone once theorized that I keep friends as pets. I\u2019m still trying to decide if that\u2019s true.<br /><br />",

   "about": "Sharan Newman is a medieval historian and author. She took her Master\u2019s degree in Medieval Literature at Michigan State University and then did her doctoral work at the University of California at Santa Barbara in Medieval Studies, specializing in twelfth-century France. She is a member of the Medieval Academy and the Medieval Association of the Pacific.<br /><br />Rather than teach, Newman chose to use her education to write novels set in the Middle Ages, including three Arthurian fantasies and ten mysteries set in twelfth-century France, featuring Catherine LeVendeur a one-time student of Heloise at the Paraclete, her husband, Edgar, an Anglo-Scot and Solomon, a Jewish merchant of Paris. The books focus on the life of the bourgeoisie and minor nobility and also the uneasy relations between Christians and Jews at that time. They also incorporate events of the twelfth-century such as the Second Crusade and the rise of the Cathars.<br /><br />For these books, Newman has done research at the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale in Paris, the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique France M\u00e9ridionale et Espagne at the University of Toulouse and the Institute for Jewish History at the University of Trier, as well as many departmental archives.<br /><br />The Catherine Levendeur mysteries have been nominated for many awards. Sharan won the Macavity Award for best first mystery for Death Comes As Epiphany and the Herodotus Award for best historical mystery of 1998 for Cursed in the Blood. The most recent book in the series The Witch in the Well won the Bruce Alexander award for best Historical mystery of 2004. <br /><br />Just for a change, her next mystery, The Shanghai Tunnel is set in Portland in 1868. <br /><br />The Shanghai Tunnel allowed Sharan Newman to explore the history of the city she grew up in. She found that the history she had been taught in school had been seriously whitewashed. Doing research in the city archives as well as the collections at Reed College and the Oregon Historical society was exciting and eye-opening. Many of the \u201cfounding fathers\u201d of Portland turn out to have been unscrupulous financiers. Chinese workers were subject to discrimination and there was an active red light district.<br /><br />On the other hand, Portland in the post-Civil War period also saw some amazingly liberal movements. Women\u2019s rights were an important issue as was religious toleration. Even at that early date, preserving the natural environment was hotly debated.<br /><br />This is the world in which Emily Stratton, the widow of a Portland merchant and the daughter of missionaries to China, finds herself. <br /><br />Newman has written a non-fiction book, The Real History Behind the Da Vince Code Berkley 2005. It is in encyclopedia format and gives information on various topics mentioned in Dan Brown\u2019s novel. Following on that she has just completed the Real History Behind the Templars published by Berkley in September of 2007.<br /><br />She lives on a mountainside in Oregon. <br /><br />(Text taken from: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sharannewman.com/bio.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sharannewman.com/bio.html</a> )",

   "about": "Some kids want to grow up to be doctors, or movie stars, or political assassins. Me, I wanted to draw comic books. Not Archie comics, either\u2014superhero comic books. Maybe it was all the heavily muscled guys in spandex\u2026<br /><br />Around the time I was 15, I realized that as much as I enjoyed drawing (note that I\u2019m saying nothing about the quality of those pics), it was a lot of fun putting words in the characters\u2019 mouths. I didn\u2019t know the term \u201cfanfic\u201d back then, but I started writing stories about the X-Men, Alpha Flight, and the Teen Titans. Didn\u2019t do anything with those stories, other than horrify my mother. She asked why I couldn\u2019t write nice stories, you know, about bunnies. Nope\u2014me, I wanted to write about power. About magic. About hot guys in spandex. And about beating those guys bloody and senseless. (In retrospect, maybe I really did want to horrify my mother. Hey, not my fault. When I was a kid, I busted her doodling on the cover of New Teen Titans #6. Argh!)<br /><br />So maybe it\u2019s ironic that the book I wound up writing had nothing to do with overly muscled men and everything to do with scantily clad women. (Well, temporarily scantily clad.) Oh, right, and demons.<br /><br />Previously, I was the fantasy editor for Wild Child Publishing. Along with working with terrific authors and editors, I\u2019d been fortunate enough to interview a number of fabulous people for WCP, including Margaret Weis (I think Raistlin was my first crush).<br /><br />In case you\u2019re wondering, I live in Upstate New York, along with my Loving Husband and two Precious Little Tax Deductions, two cats, and about 9,000 comics. (But actually, that number is now closer to 8,000, thanks to a flooded basement. Alas!)<br />",

Twenty miles away, a fledgling audiobook publisher called Brilliance was looking for narrators. <br /><br />Susan has recorded around two hundred audiobooks for Brilliance, BBC Audiobooks, Tantor, and Hachette. \"It was a natural step. As repertory theater actors, the whole point is to be able to do Shakespeare one night, a musical the next night, and Noel Coward the next.
